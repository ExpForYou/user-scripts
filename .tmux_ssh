# recall, "||" and "&&" operate on the 0/non-0 property
# of the called function's return value. If the check succeeds
# with the alternative socket path, the "ssh-add" call returns
# 0, so there is nothing more to do. It is only if the alternative
# path does not have a functional agent that a non-0 value will
# be returned.  "&&" proceeds if 0 is returned. "||" proceeds
# if non-0 is returned, thus, "||" is the correct glyph to
# use since we have additional work to do.
